####Game story and objective: 

Welcome back to the Laboratory!!

You come back to the underground laboratory you worked one year ago. This last
year the laboratory had developed new pharmaceutical products in order to treat
aggression problems in some people. Of course they haven’t tried them with
humans yet, just with some monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. They keep the
wild animals in the deepest room of the laboratory next to the research room where
you’re with Mr. Graham and Mrs. Diane doing your best to help humanity.

At the evening just before the end of the working day, a loud noise is heard in the
room next to you. The sound of something breaking in to pieces followed by
unhuman screams. Holy shit, some of the animals must have escaped, you’re in
danger. 

It’s time to get the hell out!!

The animals in the cages were very aggressive and now they run free around the
laboratory. Maybe you will need some kind of weapons in order to keep all of you
safe. Don’t give up and do your best to pull out from the building the team of
scientists, alive.
